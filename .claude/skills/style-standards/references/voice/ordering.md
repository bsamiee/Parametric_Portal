# [H1][ORDERING]
>**Dictum:** *Position determines attention weight.*

<br>

[CRITICAL] Primacy effects peak at 150-200 instructions. Earlier items receive up to 5.79× higher attention.

[IMPORTANT]:
1.  [ALWAYS] **Critical-First:** Place highest-priority constraints at sequence start.
2.  [ALWAYS] **Saturation Awareness:** Beyond 300 instructions, uniform failure emerges.

[CRITICAL]:
- [NEVER] **Middle Burial:** Middle positions suffer U-shaped attention loss.
