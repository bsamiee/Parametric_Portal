Generate Effect-based methods matching server endpoints with branded type validation. Support multiple output formats (React hooks, vanilla Effect, Promise-based for non-Effect consumers).\n\n**Rationale:** API contract exists as single source of truth (ParametricApi) but clients manually implement fetch logic. Generated clients eliminate drift between server schema and consumer code. Effect integration ensures client-side validation matches server-side rules, catching errors at request construction time.",
