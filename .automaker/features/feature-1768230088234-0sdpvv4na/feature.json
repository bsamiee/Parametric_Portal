Generate QR codes for authenticator apps, provide recovery codes on setup, and enforce MFA for sensitive operations. Support account recovery flow with email verification fallback.\n\n**Rationale:** Security-conscious users demand MFA to protect against credential compromise. Increasingly expected baseline security, especially for applications handling sensitive data or financial operations. Reduces support burden from compromised accounts.",
