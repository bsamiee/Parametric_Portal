# 0001. K3s

Date: 2025-01-15
Status: Accepted

---
## Context

Single-node VPS deployment requires Kubernetes with minimal resource overhead. Target: 2 vCPU, 8GB RAM hosting multiple services.

---
## Decision

Use **K3s v1.32** as Kubernetes distribution.

---
## Alternatives Considered

| Option   | Rejected Because                             |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| k8s      | 4GB+ RAM overhead, complex etcd setup        |
| microk8s | Snap-based, less predictable updates         |
| k0s      | Newer, smaller community, fewer integrations |
| Docker   | No native orchestration, manual scaling      |

---
## Consequences

[+] Single binary (40MB) with 10-second startup
[+] Bundled Traefik ingress controller
[+] SQLite backend (no etcd for single-node)
[+] Production-grade CNCF certification
[+] HelmChartConfig CRD for inline Helm customization
[+] Low memory footprint (~512MB baseline)
[-] Limited to Rancher's Traefik version initially
[-] Multi-master requires external etcd or embedded HA
