# 0006. Mise

Date: 2025-01-15
Status: Accepted

---
## Context

Infrastructure tasks (cluster setup, backup, secrets) require automation. Need consistent task runner across development and operations.

---
## Decision

Use **mise** for task automation, replacing shell scripts.

---
## Alternatives Considered

| Option        | Rejected Because                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Makefile      | Tab sensitivity, limited cross-platform     |
| Just          | Separate tool, less integration             |
| Shell scripts | Scattered, no dependency management         |
| Taskfile      | YAML-based, less readable for complex tasks |

---
## Consequences

[+] Unified tool/env/task management
[+] Inline bash tasks with heredoc syntax
[+] Environment variable management
[+] Already used for Node.js tooling
[+] Single `mise.toml` for all automation
[+] Tasks self-document with descriptions
[-] mise installation required
[-] Less portable than raw shell scripts
